# URL Shortener
This add-on is very simple.

We can shorten the URL easily.

There are 4 URL shortening services to choose from.

This add-on does not have a predefined gesture to launch its window, so we will have to add an input gesture by going to the NVDA/PREFERENCES/INPUT GESTURES menu, searching for the "URL Shortener" category and selecting "Activate URL Shortener Window" inside the category.

We need to make sure that the input gesture we assign does not overlap with any application or other NVDA combination.

The add-on can also be launched from the NVDA tools menu.

## Interface description
It consists of a combo box where we will select the service with which we want to shorten the URL.

We then have an edit box where we will write or paste the URL that needs to be shortened, and hitting Enter will return us to a read-only edit box where the result of the shortened URL will be.

Also if we close the tab we have a button to shorten the url.

In the read-only edit box, we can select a shortened url to share.

We then have two buttons:

* Copy to clipboard, this button is used to copy the shortened url to the clipboard.
* Close, closes the add-on.
